3D Machine Learning

In recent years, tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of 3D Machine Learning, which is an interdisciplinary field that fuses computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. This repo is derived from my study notes and will be used as a place for triaging new research papers.

I'll use the following icons to differentiate 3D representations:

üì∑ Multi-view Images
üëæ Volumetric
üé≤ Point Cloud
üíé Polygonal Mesh
üíä Primitive-based
To find related papers and their relationships, check out Connected Papers, which provides a neat way to visualize the academic field in a graph representation.

We propose an efficient yet robust technique for on-the-fly dense reconstruction and semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes.

üé≤ JSIS3D: Joint Semantic-Instance Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds (CVPR 2019) [Link]
We jointly address the problems of semantic and instance segmentation of 3D point clouds with a multi-task pointwise network that simultaneously performs two tasks: predicting the semantic classes of 3D points and embedding the points into high-dimensional vectors so that points of the same object instance are represented by similar embeddings. We then propose a multi-value conditional random field model to incorporate the semantic and instance labels and formulate the problem of semantic and instance segmentation as jointly optimising labels in the field model.

An energy-based 3D shape descriptor network is a deep energy-based model for volumetric shape patterns. The maximum likelihood training of the model follows an ‚Äúanalysis by synthesis‚Äù scheme and can be interpreted as a mode seeking and mode shifting process. The model can synthesize 3D shape patterns by sampling from the probability distribution via MCMC such as Langevin dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can generate realistic 3D shape patterns and can be useful for 3D shape analysis.

This paper proposes a deep 3D energy-based model to represent volumetric shapes. The maximum likelihood training of the model follows an ‚Äúanalysis by synthesis‚Äù scheme.

Generative PointNet is an energy-based model of unordered point clouds, where the energy function is parameterized by an input-permutation-invariant bottom-up neural network. The model can be trained by MCMC-based maximum likelihood learning, or a short-run MCMC toward the energy-based model as a flow-like generator for point cloud reconstruction and interpolation. The learned point cloud representation can be useful for point cloud classification.



üé≤ üíé Shape My Face: Registering 3D Face Scans by Surface-to-Surface Translation [Paper] [Code]

Shape My Face (SMF) is a point cloud to mesh auto-encoder for the registration of raw human face scans, and the generation of synthetic human faces. SMF leverages a modified PointNet encoder with a visual attention module and differentiable surface sampling to be independent of the original surface representation and reduce the need for pre-processing. Mesh convolution decoders are combined with a specialized PCA model of the mouth, and smoothly blended based on geodesic distances, to create a compact model that is highly robust to noise. SMF is applied to register and perform expression transfer on scans captured in-the-wild with an iPhone depth camera represented either as meshes or point clouds.



üé≤ Learning Implicit Fields for Generative Shape Modeling (2019) [Paper] [Code]

We advocate the use of implicit fields for learning generative models of shapes and introduce an implicit field decoder, called IM-NET, for shape generation, aimed at improving the visual quality of the generated shapes. An implicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape can be extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment by means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventional decoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) and shape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks such as generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction, particularly in terms of visual quality.
